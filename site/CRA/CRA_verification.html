<h4>Summary</h4>

This object-oriented method verifies the properties of spatial
forecasts of <em>entities</em>, where an entity is anything that
can be defined by a closed contour. Some examples of entities, or
blobs, are contiguous rain areas (CRAs, for which the method is
named), convective outlook regions, and low pressure minima. For
each entity that can be identified in the forecast and the
observations, CRA verification uses pattern matching techniques to
determine the location error, as well as errors in area, mean and
maximum intensity, and spatial pattern. The total error can be
decomposed into components due to location, volume, and pattern
error. This is a useful property for model developers who need such
information to improve the numerical weather prediction models. 

<p>In addition, the verified entities themselves may be classified
as "hits", "misses", etc., according to how close the forecast
location was to the observed location, and how well the maximum
intensity was represented by the forecast. This event verification
can be useful for monitoring forecast performance.</p>

<p>The CRA verification method is described below using rain
forecasts as an example. The method is described in detail by <a
href="#Ebert and McBride 2000">Ebert and McBride (2000)</a>.</p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

A good quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) correctly
predicts: 

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;rain area</li>
<li>&nbsp;rain intensity</li>
<li>&nbsp;location of rain system</li>
</ul>

Errors can occur in all of the above quantities.&nbsp; However, it
is difficult to determine the source(s) of error using traditional
verification statistics over the model domain. Traditional
verification methods&nbsp; focus on matches between the forecast
and observations at individual stations or gridpoints, and do not
consider the spatial relationship between the points. In addition,
it may be difficult to interpret the verification results for a
given spatial forecast when there is more than one feature of
interest in the domain. 

<p>When we verify a spatial forecast by eye, we compare the mapped
forecast and observations side by side, generally focussing on one
or more features of interest. The first things we notice are
whether each feature was forecast to be in the right place, and
whether it had the correct size, shape, and magnitude.</p>

<p>CRA verification is an intuitive approach that quantifies the
results of "eyeball", or visual, verification. It focuses on
individual weather systems as opposed to the entire domain,
enabling the errors in each event to be separately assessed. It
verifies the properties of the forecast entities against the
properties of the corresponding observed entities. A big advantage
of this approach over more traditional verification methods is that
the <em>location error</em> of the forecast entity can be
quantified.</p>

<h4>2. Definition of CRA</h4>

A contiguous rain area (CRA) is defined as a region bounded by a
user-specified isohyet (rain rate contour) in the forecast and/or
the observations. It is the <em>union</em> of the forecast and
observed entities (blobs). In Figure 1 below the CRA is defined as
the entire shaded area. The forecast and observed entities need not
overlap, but they must be associated with each other, which usually
means that they are nearby. 

<p><img src="CRA_entities.gif" alt="Schematic of CRA" hspace="3"
vspace="3" height="145" width="279" align="LEFT">The choice of
contour used to define the CRA depends on the application. For
example, 1 mm hr<sup>-1</sup> could be used to include all rain in
a radar-based nowcast, while 20 mm d<sup>-1</sup> could be used to
isolate the bull's eye in a daily rainfall forecast.</p>

<h4>3. Calculating location errors</h4>

The location error is determined using&nbsp; pattern matching. The
forecast field is horizontally translated over the observed field
until the best match is obtained. The location error is then simply
the vector displacement of the forecast. The method does not
consider amplification or distortion of features, unlike the
domain-based feature verification method of <a href=
"#Hoffman et al 1995">Hoffman et al. (1995)</a>. 

<p>The best match can be determined in a number of ways: (a) by
maximizing the correlation coefficient, (b) by minimizing the total
squared error, (c) by maximizing the overlap of the two entities,
and (d) by overlaying the centres of gravity of the two entities.
The domain over which these statistics are calculated includes all
gridpoints in the forecast and observed entities, before and after
translation. When the forecast matches the observations quite well,
all of the methods will give very similar location errors. However,
not all forecasts are well behaved, and it may be necessary to try
the various matching methods to see which one gives the most
intuitively pleasing results for the particular forecast
application being assessed.</p>

<h4>4. Error decomposition</h4>

When error minimization is used to determine the best pattern
match, then it is possible to decompose the total error into
components due to location error, volume (intensity) error, and
pattern error. The total mean squared error (MSE) can be written
as: 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>MSE<sub>total</sub></em> =
<em>MSE<sub>displacement</sub></em> + <em>MSE<sub>volume</sub></em>
+ <em>MSE<sub>pattern</sub></em></p>

<p>The difference between the mean square error before and after
translation is the contribution to total error due to
displacement,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<em>MSE<sub>displacement</sub></em>&nbsp; =
<em>MSE<sub>total</sub></em> - <em>MSE<sub>shifted</sub></em></p>

<p>The error component due to volume represents the bias in mean
intensity,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>MSE<sub>volume</sub></em> = (
<strong><em>F</em></strong> - <strong><em>X</em></strong>
)<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>where <strong><em>F</em></strong> and
<strong><em>X</em></strong> are the CRA mean forecast and observed
values after the shift. The pattern error accounts for differences
in the fine structure of the forecast and observed fields,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>MSE<sub>pattern</sub></em> =
<em>MSE<sub>shifted</sub></em> - <em>MSE<sub>volume</sub></em></p>

<p>Note that it may be possible to do the error decomposition when
other pattern matching criteria are used. However, it is not
guaranteed because the mean squared error may not decrease for the
"best" match, giving in this case a negative pattern error.</p>

<h4>5. A few examples</h4>

<img src="CRA_LAPS20010201.gif" alt=
"CRA for LAPS forecast in eastern Australia for 1 February 2001"
hspace="3" vspace="3" border="0" height="515" width="440">CRA
verification has been used to verify 24 h QPFs from the Australian
regional forecast model since mid-1999. Figure 2 shows the CRA
verification for a heavy rain event on the east coast of Australia
in February 2001. A contour of 20 mm d<sup>-1</sup> was chosen to
isolate the region of greatest interest. The heaviest rain was
forecast slightly to the northwest of where it actually occurred,
as shown by the arrow. If it had been forecast in the correct
location the RMS error would have been roughly half the original
value and the correlation coefficient would also have been much
better. The forecast area and intensity of the rain were predicted
reasonably well. For this event about 70% of the total error was
associated with the error in location, and most of the remaining
error was associated with the fine scale structure. <br>
<img src="CRA_auton20001103.gif" alt=
"CRA verification for Autonowcaster radar-based nowcast" hspace="3"
vspace="3" height="519" width="619">The second example is for a
radar-based nowcast of rain in a severe storm near Sydney in
November 2000. The storm moved to the left of the mean flow,
leading to an error in the forecast position of about 13 km to the
southwest. The nowcast overestimated the size and rain volume of
the storm. In this event most of the error was split between
displacement and pattern error, while 9% of the total error was due
to incorrect rain volume. 

<p>When the CRA verification is applied to a large number of
entities, it is possible to diagnose systematic errors in the
forecasts (e.g., Ebert and McBride, 2000). An example is shown
below. The dominant sources of error can also be diagnosed.<br>

height="283" width="476"></p>

<h4>6. Event verification</h4>

Another way that entity-based verification can quantify visual
verification is to categorize the forecasts for the <em>events</em>
themselves as "hits", "misses", etc., depending on whether their
location and intensity were well predicted. 

<p>The specific criteria for what constitutes "well predicted"
depends on the needs of the user. For example, for spatial 24 h
rain forecasts Ebert and McBride (2000) specified that (a) the
location error must be within one effective radius of the rain
system, but not more than 5 degrees latitude/longitude, and (b) the
forecast maximum rain rate must be within one category of the
observed (categories bounded by 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 150, and
200 mm d<sup>-1</sup>).</p>

<p>Based on the designated location and intensity criteria, an
<em>event contingency table</em> can be constructed:</p>

<table cellspacing="3" cellpadding="4" summary="Event contingency table">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td align="CENTER"><strong>Intensity</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td align="CENTER">Too little</td>
<td valign="CENTER">Approx. correct</td>
<td align="CENTER">Too much</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Location</strong></td>
<td align="RIGHT">Close</td>
<td bgcolor="#66FFFF">Underestimate</td>
<td align="CENTER" bgcolor="#66FFFF">Hit</td>
<td align="CENTER" bgcolor="#66FFFF">Overestimate</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="CENTER">Far</td>
<td align="CENTER" bgcolor="#66FFFF">Missed Event</td>
<td align="CENTER" bgcolor="#66FFFF">Missed location</td>
<td align="CENTER" bgcolor="#66FFFF">False alarm</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>A missed event can also occur when an entity was observed but
not predicted at all. Similarly, a false alarm can occur when an
entity was predicted but did not occur. While in these cases it is
impossible to determine a location or intensity error, it is still
important to include them in the event verification.</p>

<p>Event verification for a large number of CRAs can give useful
information on the nature of the forecast errors. These
descriptions could prove a useful tool for monitoring forecast
performance over time.</p>

<p>An example for the Australian regional model is shown below,
where the results are stratified according to the observed maximum
intensity of the events. For all events together (threshold of 0 mm
d<sup>-1</sup>) the event hit rate was close to 50%, while the most
common type of error was a missed location. The event hit rate
improves slightly as the rain events become more intense, then
rapidly drops when the observed intensity exceeds 100 mm
d<sup>-1</sup>. Although the forecast location was good for these
very heavy rain events, their intensity was underestimated by the
model.<br>

<h4>7. Strengths and weaknesses of CRA verification</h4>

The entity-based CRA verification method has a number of attractive
features: 

<blockquote>(a) It is intuitive, quantifying what we can see by
eye<br>
(b) it estimates the location error in the forecast,<br>
(c) the total error can be decomposed into contributions from
location, intensity, and pattern,<br>
(d) forecast events can be categorized as hits, misses, etc. These
descriptions could prove a useful tool for monitoring forecast
performance over time.</blockquote>

There are also some drawbacks to this approach: 

<blockquote>(a) Because it depends on pattern matching, it must be
possible to associate entities in the forecast with entities in the
observations. This means that the forecast must be halfway decent.
The verification results for a large number of CRAs will be biased
toward the "decent" forecasts, i.e., those for which location and
intensity errors could reliably be determined.<br>
(b) The user must choose the pattern matching method as well as the
isoline used to define the entities. The verification results will
be somewhat dependent on these choices.<br>
(c) When a forecast and/or observed entity extends across the
boundary of the domain it is not possible to be sure whether the
pattern match is optimal. If the CRA has a reasonably large area
still within the domain then the probability of a good match is
high. Ebert and McBride (2000) suggest applying a minimum area
criterion to address this issue.</blockquote>

The CRA verification methodology has so far been successfully
applied to 6- and 24-hourly numerical precipitation forecasts
(Ebert and McBride, 2000; Ebert et al., 2002a; Loughe et al.,
2002</a>), radar-based rainfall nowcasts (Ebert et al., 2002b),
convective outlooks, and satellite precipitation estimates (Ebert,
2002).
